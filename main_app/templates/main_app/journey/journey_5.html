    <h4>KEYS TO MANAGING YOUR MONEY</h4>
    <h6>The following <a href="https://handsonbanking.org/" class="font-weight-bold" target="_blank">keys to managing your money</a> from Hands on Banking are a 
    large part of a being a wise consumer.</h6>

    <h5 >Control Your Spending</h5>
    <p>Do you try to <span class="font-weight-bold">distinguish between needs and wants</span>? Do you save up enough money until you can pay cash for something without borrowing the money or putting 
    it on a credit card? Prioritize your spending. Try not to be an impulse buyer. Think about what you really want to buy and whether you are getting a good deal.</p>
    <div class="">
    <h5 >Devise a Budget</h5>
    <p>Do you know how much you really spend per month (for example, expenses for eating out, entertainment, clothes, car insurance, or buying electronics)?  
    Do you spend more than you make if you have a part-time job? Putting together a monthly budget and sticking to it is a key to your financial future.
    <h5 >Save Money</h5>
    <p>Part of the budgeting process should be establishing a savings plan. You should be paying yourself before you pay others. In other words, <span class="font-weight-bold">put some money in 
    savings</span>. Try to set a goal of saving ten percent of what you make and placing the money in an interest bearing savings account, certificate of deposit (CD), or 
    checking account. This will assist you when making needed large purchases or paying for unexpected expenditures like car repairs.
    <h5 >Be Saavy About Credit Cards</h5>
    <p>Did you know that the average college student graduates with credit card debt of more than $4,100? <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/finance/financial-literacy/how-to-be-a-savvy-credit-cardholder-1.aspx" 
    class="font-weight-bold" target="_blank">Be credit card smart</a>! One way to avoid this is to <span class="font-weight-bold">pay cash for as much as you 
    can or pay off your credit card balance monthly</span> instead of making minimum payments. Most college students have credit cards that carry an Average Percentage Rate (APR) 
    of 18 percent or more. Donâ€™t take cash advances on credit cards since they charge large fees. In addition, late credit card payments can vastly increase monthly payments 
    or make your interest rates skyrocket.
    <h5>Establish and Maintain Good Credit</h5>
    <p>Wise money management will lead to establishing good credit and securing lower interest rates. This becomes very important when you purchase a car or home in the future. 
    <span class="text-danger">Excessive spending, making late credit or car payments, and not paying student loans can damage your credit history for the next seven to ten years</span>.
