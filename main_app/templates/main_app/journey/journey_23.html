    <p>You will need to <a href="https://resumegenius.com/resume-samples" class="font-weight-bold" target="_blank">prepare a personal resume</a>. A resume is a one or two page summary of your skills, accomplishments, experiences, and education, designed to capture an employer’s interest and get you an interview. It is your personal poster or Web page telling about yourself and why you are qualified for the job.  
    
    <p><strong>Here are some tips</strong>:</p>
    
    <div class="container mt-3 pl-5 mb-4">
    <p>• Start your resume with the job objective at the beginning.
    <p>• Show your best attributes and skills so the employer will want to meet you.
    <p>• Make your experience and education appropriate to the job you are seeking.
    <p>• Be honest about what you list.
    <p>• Ask someone like a school counselor, career center technician, or teacher to read your draft and give you suggestions.
    <p>• Organize your experiences and skills on your resume to help you prepare for an interview.
    <p>• Always prepare a well-organized, easy-to-read printed resume (<strong><span class="text-danger">hand written resumes are not acceptable</span></strong>).

    <p>• Allow plenty of time to develop your resume.
    <p>• Ask your teacher, school counselor, club advisor, or coach to be a reference.
