    <h4>DISCOVERING YOUR SKILLS AND INTERESTS</h4>
    <p>A good place to start your career exploration is with your personal interests and skills. You know what you like and you have developed some interests and skills, such as working with animals, computer literacy, playing an instrument, helping less fortunate people, or keeping up with the latest fashion. There are areas in which you haven’t had experience yet and are willing to explore. 
    
    <p>When you complete your interest inventory, you will be asked to respond to those things you already like and those you may be interested in exploring. In <a href="http://www.careeronestop.org/explorecareers/assessments/skills.aspx" class="font-weight-bold" target="_blank">assessing your skills</a>, you will discover what you already know and identify new skills you will want to develop.

    <p>If you want to complete a <a href="https://www.cacareerzone.org/" class="font-weight-bold" target="_blank">personal assessment</a> at home, you can consult many online career Web sites. When you take an inventory, it is recommended that you be as honest as possible about your interests and skills.
