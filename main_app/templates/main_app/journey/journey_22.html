    <p>According to the U.S.  Department of Labor, about <strong>80% of available jobs are never advertised</strong>.  These jobs are part of what is called the “hidden” job market.  Many businesses use word of mouth to find new employees. Therefore, it is important for you to network, that is, talk to people you know to learn about jobs and find jobs. 

    <p>Hold an informational interview with at least three of these people. This is simply gathering information through contacts. Take notes. Ask them about their career path. Why did they choose their particular career? What does a typical day look like for them? What education/training is required? Where can you find more information about their career field? What about future openings in the field? You may also want to inquire as to the possiblity of getting a summer job or internship in their organization.

    <p>Shadow one or more of these people at their place of work for a day during one of your holiday breaks or vacations. How did you like the work environment? Is this a career field which might match your talents and interests?</p>
