    <h4>CALIFORNIA GRANTS</h4> 
    <p>In addition to Federal Student Aid, California also provides grants.  Every high school senior who graduates, meets academic, financial and eligibility 
    requirements, and applies on time, is guaranteed a Cal Grant award to attend college. In other words, this is free money. It costs nothing for you to apply 
    and does not have to be repaid! There are several <a href="https://mygrantinfo.csac.ca.gov/" class="font-weight-bold" target="_blank">Cal Grant Programs</a>:
