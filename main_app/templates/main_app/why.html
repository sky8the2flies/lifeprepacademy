    <p>1. By empowering families to advocate for their childâ€™s transition to life after high school, we can increase the number of low-to-middle income and first generation youth that graduate from high school college ready and prepared to enter the workforce.
    <br><br>
        2. With student-to-counselor ratios of more than 600:1 in California, <span class="text-warning font-weight-bold">parent engagement</span> is critical to ensuring youth reach their potential. LifePrep
        Academy resources and webinars teach families how to efficiently work with counselors to achieve the best results for youth.
    <br><br>
        3. <span class="font-weight-bold">Since 1998</span>, hundreds of schools, nonprofits, churches and colleges have relied upon the LifePrep Academy to prepare youth for life after high school.
    <br><br>
        4. We offer schools and districts a <span class="text-warning font-weight-bold">cost effective</span> alternative to Naviance, Xello and other online programs for achieving their LCAP goals.
