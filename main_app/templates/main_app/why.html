    <p>By empowering families to advocate for their childâ€™s transition to life after high school, we can increase the number of low-to-middle income and first generation youth that graduate from high school college ready and prepared to enter the workforce.
    
    <p>With student-to-counselor ratios of more than 600:1 in many California schools, <span class="text-warning font-weight-bold">parent engagement</span> is critical to ensuring youth reach their potential. LifePrep Academy resources and webinars teach families how to efficiently work with counselors to achieve the best results for youth.
    
    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Since 1998</span>, hundreds of schools, nonprofits, churches and colleges have relied upon the LifePrep Academy to prepare youth for life after high school.
    
    <p>We offer schools and districts a <span class="text-warning font-weight-bold">cost effective</span> alternative to Naviance, Xello and other online programs for achieving their LCAP goals. Professional development trainings are available for counselors, teachers and administrators - along with workshops or webinars for students and parents.
    
    <p>Site license models are available that provide complete access to LifePrep Academy courses to <span class="text-warning font-weight-bold">every enrolled student and their parents</span>. LifePrep Academy is the perfect resource for schools and districts
    that provide iPads, Chromebooks or other devices for their students.

    <p>Schools and districts receive a co-branded dashboard for their families, where students and parents can access the LifePrep Academy curriculum, California-based scholarships, a database of homework help sites, a list of their favorite sites, 
    pre- and post-activity surveys and more.
