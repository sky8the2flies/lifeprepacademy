or the <a href="https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/subject-requirement-a-g.html" target="_blank" class="font-weight-bold">University of California</a>, 
you must complete <span class="font-weight-bold italic">15 year-long high school courses</span> with a letter grade of C or better â€” at least 11 of them prior to your last year of high school.

<br><br>Keep in mind that taking approved high school (A-G) courses isn't the only way to satisfy these requirements. You also may meet them by completing college courses or earning certain scores on SAT, 
Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate exams.
