    <h4>COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMS</h4>
    <p>In order to apply for most colleges/universities you will be required to take an entrance exam. You will need to check with the college/university that you anticipate 
    attending to find out which exam or exams are accepted as part of the admissions proces.</p>
</div>
<div class="container mb-5">
    <h4>THE PRELIMINARY SAT (PSAT) 8/9</h4>
    <p>The <a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/psat-8-9" class="font-weight-bold" target="_blank">Preliminary SAT (PSAT) 8/9</a>
    measures three areas:  critical reading skills; math problem solving skills (including numbers and operation, algebra and functions, 
    geometry and measurement, data analysis, statistics, and probability), and writing skills. The PSAT provides you with practice for the 
    SAT Reasoning Test. 
    <br><br>You will receive feedback on your strengths and weaknesses. This will provide you with a road map for additional study and 
    preparation prior to taking the SAT. It will also familiarize you with the types of questions and directions on the SAT.
    <br><br>It is recommended that students take a preliminary college test in October of their sophomore or junior year. If you take the 
    test in grade 11 and do well, you might qualify for participation in the <a href="https://www.nationalmerit.org/s/1758/start.aspx?gid=2&pgid=61" class="font-weight-bold" target="_blank">National 
    Merit Scholarship</a> competition.
    <br><br>Brochures and dates for this test are available in your school counseling office.  <a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/psat-nmsqt-psat-10/k12-educators/requesting-fee-waivers" 
    class="font-weight-bold" target="_blank">Fee waivers</a> are available for juniors from low-income families.  Please see your school counselor regarding this test.</p>

    <h4>SAT REASONING AND SUBJECT TESTS</h4>
    <p>Normally, the <a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat" class="font-weight-bold" target="_blank">SAT</a> Reasoning Test is taken during your junior or senior year. The SAT Reasoning Test is made up of three sections:  critical reading (reading comprehension, sentence completion, 
    and critical reading passages); mathematics (number and operations, algebra and functions, geometry, statistics, probability, and data analysis) and writing (both multiple-choice questions and short essay).  
    You can choose which scores to send to most colleges, if you take the test more than once. 
    <br><br>SAT Subject Tests should normally be taken at the conclusion of your junior year, the beginning of your senior year, or when you have completed a specific subject. They are designed to measure knowledge, 
    skills, and application in specific subjects such as English, history, math, science, and language.

    <br><br><span class="font-weight-bold">IMPORTANT:</span> Consult the Web sites of the colleges you are considering applying to in order to determine which SAT Subject Tests, if any, are required.  For example, the UC system requires the SAT or ACT 
    Reasoning Test.  The CSU system only requires the SAT Reasoning Test.

    <h4>ACT</h4> 
    <p>All colleges and universities in the United States accept either the SAT or ACT for admission purposes. The ACT is divided into four required sections:  English (punctuation, grammar and usage, sentence structure, 
    and rhetorical skills); mathematics (skills typically acquired in courses up through the end of the 11th grade); reading comprehension and science (STEM, interpretation, analysis, evaluation, reasoning, and problem-solving skills 
    required in general or introductory science courses). The optional Writing Test measures skills in high school English classes and entry-level college composition courses.

    <br><br>The UC system requires the ACT plus the Writing Test. The CSU system does not require scores from the Writing Test for admission.

    <br><br>Free ACT practice is available on <a href="https://cloud.e.act.org/free-practice-act-test" class="font-weight-bold" target="_blank">ACT Test Prep</a> site. <a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/college-advice/good-act-scores" class="font-weight-bold" target="_blank">What is a good ACT Score?</a>
    
    <br><br>Like the SAT, you can choose which scores to send to most colleges. ACT <a href="http://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/registration/fees.html" class="font-weight-bold" target="_blank">fee waivers</a> are 
    available to students who cannot afford the test fees. The ACT <a href="https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act.html" class="font-weight-bold" target="_blank">test dates</a> are listed on their website.
