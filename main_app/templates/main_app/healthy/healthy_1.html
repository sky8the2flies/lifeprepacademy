    <h4>THE ROLE OF DIET, EXERCISE AND SLEEP</h4>
    <img src="https://lifeprep-academy.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Journey/Healthy1.jpg" class="float-right ml-3" alt="Career Tools" style="width: 300px; height: 190px;">
    <p>You have begun your academic and career planning for high school and started your preparation for post secondary education and work. You also may have begun to take college classes and enter the world of work with your first paying job. The second area of mastery in preparation for the future is healthy living and effective personal/social skills.

    <p>It should be a priority to eat three healthy meals per day, including at least two to four servings of fruit an three to five servings of vegetables. Fat, cholesterol, salt, and sugar intake should be minimized. <strong>Skipping breakfast can affect your academic performance in school</strong>.

    <p><strong>Exercise should be an ongoing routine throughout life</strong>. Exercise benefits us physically and mentally by reducing stress. Exercise at least three to four days per week. It should include continuous (aerobic) physical activity for at least 20 to 30 minutes without stopping. Examples of aerobic exercise include brisk walking, basketball, bicycling, swimming, in-line skating, soccer, and jogging.

    <p>Most people need eight hours of sleep per night. <strong>Adequate sleep is as important as diet and exercise for good health and a long life</strong>. There is a link between sleep deprivation and increased risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, depression, heart attack, and stroke according to the Institute of Medicine. Inadequate sleep will hinder academic progress by reducing your memory, focus, concentration, and reaction time.</p>
