    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">You</span> are about to begin a very exciting and challenging phase of your life. Having a plan to graduate is the start of your plan to succeed. You also know that your family is an 
    important part of helping you plan for your time in high school and for those years after high school.
    <br><br>
    Today you are embarking on a journey that will provide the stepping stones to a great life. Your first step is getting ready to go, passport in hand—high school diploma—on your journey.
    <br><br>
    The LifePrep Academy has been designed to assist you and your family in planning for high school graduation and success in life. The curriculum can help you chart the itinerary for your trip; it is divided into eight major sections:
    <br><br>
    <span class="font-weight-bold">SECTION I:</span> Middle School: Ready to Grow
    <br><br><span class="font-weight-bold">SECTION II:</span> Getting Prepared: Your High School Diploma
    <br><br> <span class="font-weight-bold">SECTION III:</span> The Journey: Life After High School
    <br><br> <span class="font-weight-bold">SECTION IV:</span> Health Living and Effective Personal Skills
    <br><br> <span class="font-weight-bold">SECTION V:</span> Homework Help Sites
    <br><br> <span class="font-weight-bold">SECTION VI:</span> Scholarship Search Engines
    <br><br> <span class="font-weight-bold">SECTION VII:</span> Notes
    <br><br> <span class="font-weight-bold">SECTION VIII:</span> Favorite Links
    <br><br>
    Section I focuses on <span class="font-weight-bold">developing the right mind frame</span> in the middle school years to prepare for high school. Section II discusses 
    <span class="font-weight-bold">resources</span> you'll need to get your high school diploma, your real passport to the future. Section III starts with life after high 
    school and explores the many <span class="font-weight-bold">post secondary options</span> you have before you. Section IV covers the role of diet, exercise and sleep 
    in helping students <span class="font-weight-bold">achieve success</span> during the high school years and beyond.
    <br><br>
    Section V provides a database of more than 2,500 <span class="font-weight-bold">educational websites</span> that students can use to do research, find help with their 
    homework and further their studies. Section VI offers a database of hundreds of <span class="font-weight-bold">California-based scholarships</span> and search engines.
    Section VII allow students to take notes on the important topics they learn while using the LifePrep Academy, and Section VIII is
